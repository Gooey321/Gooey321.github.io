I'll probably be using this site to put projects and other stuff on to showcase. Just a place to mess around on.

In this post i'll be exploring some of jekyll's features!

## Features Demonstrated

- **Layouts**: Defined in `_layouts/default.html`.
- **Front Matter**: YAML at the top of the file.
- **Dynamic Content**: Using Liquid templating.
- **Excerpt**: Brief summary shown in feeds.
- **Posts**: Stored in `_posts/` directory.
