# Physics Engine

A custom *slightly buggy* physics engine built from scratch for simulating basic physical interactions between objects. Like making a platformer game

## Features
- Basic collision detection and response
- Gravity and friction simulation
- Click to spawn a cube
- Simple rendering of objects on a canvas
- Adding rectangles of various sizes to the canvas
